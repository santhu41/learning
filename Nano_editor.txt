xargs
The xargs command is used in a UNIX shell to
convert input from standard input into arguments to a
command.
In other words, through the use of xargs the output
of a command is used as the input of another
command.
Here's the syntax you will use:
command1 | xargs command2




sudo user privilages

sai123 ALL = All python3
Runas_Alias		WEB = www-data, apache
GROUPONE	ALL = (WEB) ALL
